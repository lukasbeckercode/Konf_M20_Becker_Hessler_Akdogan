# Test Coverage Explanation
Testing the <b>Main.java</b> seems useless, as it just calls all the other methods from the different Classes. <br />
<b>Coffee.java</b> Class can be seen as deprecated as the creator of this class has to repeat the first semester and therefore is no
longer contributing to this project. <br /> 
The <b>Registrierkasse.java</b> class shows 100% Coverage in IntelliJ but javacoco shows a litte less. However, I still 
believe it is tested sufficiently <br />
All the other Classes have a Coverage of 100%. <br />
